# Fast Turtle Bot

This repo is a quick way to get started using the turtlebot tutorials, in particular [this](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#gazebo-simulation) one. 

# Requirements

You will require: 
- Windows 11 
- GPU 
- Docker Desktop Installed 
- VS Code

# Setup 

1, Clone repository and open VS Code
2, Hit Ctr-Shift-P and search for "Remote Containers: Open Folder In Container"
3, VS Code should recognise the docker-compose.yaml file, choose the option to create a configuration from the docker-compose file. 

Docker will download the image and then install the neccesary libraries. 

You can use the remote extension to open terminals, use gui apps such as Gazebo, RViz, etc.
